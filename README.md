Hey! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple BMW landing page I made using just HTML and CSS. Wanted to create a clean, modern look that gives off the premium BMW vibe.

A clean and responsive clone of the official Spotify landing page built using only HTML and CSS. This project is a front-end practice exercise focused on layout, styling, and responsiveness.

## What I used:

- HTML5 for structure  
- CSS3 for all the styling

## Features:
- Responsive design (works on mobile too)
- Clean layout with BMW style branding
- Easy to edit and understand
